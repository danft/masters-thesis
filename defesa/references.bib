	abstract = {This paper introduces a new model for the planar maximal covering location problem (PMCLP) under different block norms. The problem involves locating g facilities anywhere on the plane in order to cover the maximum number of n given demand points. The generalization, in this paper, is that the distance measures assigned to facilities are block norms of different types and different proximity measures. First, the PMCLP under different block norms is modelled as a maximum clique partition problem on an equivalent multi-interval graph. Then, the equivalent graph problem is modelled as an unconstrained binary quadratic problem (UQP). Both the maximum clique partition problem and the UQP are NP-hard problems; therefore, we solve the UQP format through a genetic algorithm heuristic. Computational examples are given.},

	abstract="In this paper an implicit (double) shifted QR-method for computing the eigenvalues of companion and fellow matrices will be presented. Companion and fellow matrices are Hessenberg matrices, that can be decomposed into the sum of a unitary and a rank 1 matrix. The Hessenberg, the unitary as well as the rank 1 structures are preserved under a step of the QR-method. This makes these matrices suitable for the design of a fast QR-method. Several techniques already exist for performing a QR-step. The implementation of these methods is highly dependent on the representation used. Unfortunately for most of the methods compression is needed since one is not able to maintain all three, unitary, Hessenberg and rank 1 structures. In this manuscript an implicit algorithm will be designed for performing a step of the QR-method on the companion or fellow matrix based on a new representation consisting of Givens transformations. Moreover, no compression is needed as the specific representation of the involved matrices is maintained. Finally, also a double shift version of the implicit method is presented.",

	abstract="The problem of finding all roots of an exponential or trigonometric equation is reduced to the determination of zeros of algebraic polynomials where the well-known Durand-Kerner algorithm can be applied. This transformation of the problem has the additional advantage that the periodicity of the original functions is eliminated and the choice of starting values is simplified.",

	title={{Optimizing source and receiver placement in multistatic sonar networks to monitor fixed targets}},

	abstract={Multistatic sonar networks consisting of non-collocated sources and receivers are a promising development in sonar systems, but they present distinct mathematical challenges compared to the monostatic case in which each source is collocated with a receiver. This paper is the first to consider the optimal placement of both sources and receivers to monitor a given set of target locations. Prior publications have only considered optimal placement of one type of sensor, given a fixed placement of the other type. We first develop two integer linear programs capable of optimally placing both sources and receivers within a discrete set of locations. Although these models are capable of placing both sources and receivers to any degree of optimality desired by the user, their computation times may be unacceptably long for some applications. To address this issue, we then develop a two-step heuristic process, Adapt-LOC, that quickly selects positions for both sources and receivers, but with no guarantee of optimality. Based on this, we also create an iterative approach, Iter-LOC, which leads to a locally optimal placement of both sources and receivers, at the cost of larger computation times relative to Adapt-LOC. Finally, we perform computational experiments demonstrating that the newly developed algorithms constitute a powerful portfolio of tools, enabling the user to slect an appropriate level of solution quality, given the available time to perform computations. Our experiments include three real-world case studies.},

We show how the contributions of the papers we review are embedded in the field. A summary and outlook conclude the paper."
