I would like to express my gratitude to CAPES for funding this research for almost two years; without it, this work would not be possible.
I want to also acknowledge all the professors from the \textit{Laboratório de Otimização} at ICMC for the great work environment we have here at the University of São Paulo. 
Finally, I would like to thank my advisor, Dra. Marina Andretta, for all the insights, the peaceful guidance, and for always detecting the errors in my ideas very quickly.
