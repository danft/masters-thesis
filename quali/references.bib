@article{graphical-clique,
title = "Unit disk graphs",
abstract = "Unit disk graphs are the intersection graphs of equal sized circles in the plane: they provide a graph-theoretic model for broadcast networks (cellular networks) and for some problems in computational geometry. We show that many standard graph theoretic problems remain NP-complete on unit disk graphs, including coloring, independent set, domination, independent domination, and connected domination; NP-completeness for the domination problem is shown to hold even for grid graphs, a subclass of unit disk graphs. In contrast, we give a polynomial time algorithm for finding cliques when the geometric representation (circles in the plane) is provided.",
